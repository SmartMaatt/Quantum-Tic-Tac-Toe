The above board represents the initial state of the game. |ф> represents the superposition state! Always, the user is given the chance to make the first move. [0> and |1> represent the piece chosen by the Computer and User respectively. However, unlike the classical tic tac toe, there's not a 100% probability that when computer/user make their move, it will result into their respective move. For eg, if user selects a piece, it's actually possible that the piece take the value of |0> and not |1>. This is the Quantum effect of Quantum Superposition in the Quantum Tic Tac Toe!
